# fraud
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting fraudulent transactions in real-time. Leveraging a diverse dataset containing transactional features such as transaction amount, frequency, and other variables. we employ XGBoost machine learning algorithms to detect anomalous activities indicative of fraud.
